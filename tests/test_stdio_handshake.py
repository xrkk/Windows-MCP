"""End-to-end stdio transport tests against a real server subprocess.

Every other test in this suite calls tool functions in-process, which skips
the MCP lifecycle entirely. These tests spawn ``windows-mcp serve`` over a
real stdio pipe and drive it the way a client does, so they cover the layer
in between: the initialize handshake, JSON-RPC framing, and the advertised
tool surface.

The handshake is easy to get wrong by hand. A client that sends a request
before completing::

    --> initialize
    <-- (response)
    --> notifications/initialized

gets ``-32602 Invalid request parameters`` on stdout and
``Failed to validate request: Received request before initialization was
complete`` on stderr. ``test_request_before_initialize_is_rejected`` pins
that behaviour so the failure mode stays recognizable instead of being
mistaken for a server-side startup race.

Requires Windows: the server imports comtypes and pywin32 at startup.
